# ICO-playground
This repository contains the code for an toy ICO developed as part of a [Blockchain programming course](https://github.com/fccoelho/Curso_Blockchain).

## Organization of the repository
As this course is offered at least once a year to a different class, the actual implementations of each class will remain on branches named `<year>_project`. The master branch will only contain the basic project structure.

## Getting started instructions
The instruction for setting up your development environment can be found [here](https://github.com/fccoelho/Curso_Blockchain/blob/master/lectures/build-your-own-ICO.md).
